# HM133_DTMF_Adapter_3D-Cover
OpenSCAD 3D printed cover for the HM133 DTMF Adapter. 
See http://www.rollanet.org/~joeh/projects/hm133/ for project hardware details.
</p>
This 3D print is 1/2 of the cover.  Print two identical parts and mate them together to get a complete cover.

This is the first run design.  It works, but needs some tweaking to get the shells to fit together more easily.
