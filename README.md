# HM133_DTMF_Adapter_3D-Cover
OpenSCAD 3D printed cover for the HM133 DTMF Adapter.  See https://www.openscad.org/ to download OpenSCAD and access toutorials and instruction manuals.

See http://www.rollanet.org/~joeh/projects/hm133/ for project description.

This 3D print is 1/2 of the cover.  Print two identical parts and mate them together to get a complete cover.

This is RevA of the cover, it has yet to be tested but likely needs some tweaking (e.g., trimming and sanding) to get the shells to fit together.
